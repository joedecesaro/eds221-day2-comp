#### I want to create a scatterplot of flipper length vs body mass, with boddy mass converted to kg, only for Adelie penguins.
```{r}
# Before starting you would want to first observe your data and understand it.

adelies <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000)

ggplot(data = adelies, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_kg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = island)) +
  facet_wrap(~island)

unique(adelies$species)
# in the `filter()` you don't need to include the data in the condition while piping straight into it.
# Always check your data after EACH pipe step.
```
